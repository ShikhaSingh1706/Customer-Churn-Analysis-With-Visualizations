**Title:** *Customer Churn Analysis with Visualizations*  

**Description:**  
This repository contains an end-to-end analysis of customer churn data using Python. The project explores various factors influencing churn, visualizes trends, and provides actionable insights to improve customer retention. Key highlights include:  

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, data type conversions, and data cleaning for accurate analysis.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Demographic breakdowns (e.g., gender, age) and their impact on churn.  
  - Service adoption trends, such as `InternetService`, `TechSupport`, and `StreamingTV`.  
  - Churn visualizations using bar plots, pie charts, and subplots for in-depth understanding.  
- **Key Insights:** High churn observed in customers without optional add-ons and among fiber optic users.  
- **Visualization Tools:** Seaborn and Matplotlib for clear, impactful charts.  

This project is perfect for data enthusiasts aiming to understand customer behavior and improve decision-making through data-driven insights.  

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook.
